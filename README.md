# Memory Game

This repository contains a simple browser-based memory matching game implemented with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Running the Game

Open `index.html` in your web browser. You can double-click the file or serve the folder with a local HTTP server and navigate to it.

## Customization

Card values and the game timer are defined in `script.js`:

- **Cards**: Modify the `items` array to change the card pairs. Each item can be text or an image.
- **Timer**: The `timeLimit` constant sets the countdown duration in milliseconds.

Have fun!
